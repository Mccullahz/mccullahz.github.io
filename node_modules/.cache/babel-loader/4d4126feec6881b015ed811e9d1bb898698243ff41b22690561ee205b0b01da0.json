[Scraping](#scraping)\\n\\t1. [Concurrency](#concurrency)\\n6. [Writer](#writer)\\n\\n\\n## Overview\\nThis CLI Job Scraper is a Go powered TUI application that finds nearby business websites and searches them for career or job listing pages. The goal is to automate localized job hunting by surfacing hiring pages often buried in small business websites. \\n\\nBy searching only these local businesses, applicants can find job opportunities that may not be listed on larger job boards, reducing resume traffic and potentially aiding in landing a desired position.\\n\\n## Structure\\nThis project is structured similar to a standard Go application, with the main logic in the 'cmd' directory. This main function only acts as the entry point of the project. The rest of the Go packages are placed inside the internal directory, and further split into packages to modulate each function. \\n\\nTUI interface is inside the ui package, the 'scraper' that handles HTTP requests is located inside web, and so fourth.\\n\\n## Terminal Interface\\nThe TUI is built using the Bubbletea library, which provides a simple and effective way to create terminal user interfaces in Go, and styled with the Lipgloss addition to Bubbletea. The interface allows users to input a ZIP code, select a radius for scraping, and view the results in a structured format. The UI is designed to be intuitive and responsive, and will eventually be able to provide real time feedback as the scraper processes each website.\\n\\n## Geo (Locator)\\nThe 'Geo' package is responsible for the handling of geographic data, such as ZIP codes and their associated locations. The current idea is to use the [Zippopotamus API](https://docs.zippopotam.us/) to fetch location data based on ZIP codes. \\nThis package should provide functionality to fetch geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). \\n\\nFrom here, we can use these coordinates to locate nearby businesses via the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). If this fails, we can pivot to either the Google Maps API or perhaps Yelp, but these will require 1.) API keys and 2.) money.\\n\\nOnce we have the coordinates from Zippopotamus, we can use the Overpass API to query OpenStreetMap for nearby businesses. We should then be able to throw the results into a 'geo-results' json file and throw the results into the 'web' package to be scraped.\\n### Zippopotamus API\\nWhile there is not an official Go client for the Zippopotamus API, it is a simple REST API that we can interact with using 'net/http'. This implementation can look the following example in the codebase:\\n```go\\nfunc GetCoordinatesFromZip(zip string) (float64, float64, error) {\\n\\turl := fmt.Sprintf(\\\"https://api.zippopotam.us/us/%s\\\", zip)\\n\\tresp, err := http.Get(url)\\n\\tif err != nil {\\n\\t\\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\\\"HTTP request failed: %w\\\", err)\\n\\t}\\n\\tdefer resp.Body.Close()\\n\\n\\tbody, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)\\n\\tif err != nil {\\n\\t\\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\\\"reading response failed: %w\\\", err)\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvar data ZippoResponse\\n\\tif err := json.Unmarshal(body, &data); err != nil {\\n\\t\\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\\\"JSON unmarshal failed: %w\\\", err)\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tif len(data.Places) == 0 {\\n\\t\\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\\\"no places found for zip %s\\\", zip)\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tplace := data.Places[0]\\n\\tlat, err1 := strconv.ParseFloat(place.Latitude, 64)\\n\\tlon, err2 := strconv.ParseFloat(place.Longitude, 64)\\n\\tif err1 != nil || err2 != nil {\\n\\t\\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\\\"invalid coordinates in API response\\\")\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn lat, lon, nil\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhile this function is perhaps one of the most significant in this project, it is also quite simple. All we are doing is making a GET request to the Zippo API, reading the response, and unmarshalling the JSON into a struct. \\n\\nWe know that our JSON will look similar to this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"post code\\\": \\\"90210\\\",\\n  \\\"country\\\": \\\"United States\\\",\\n  \\\"country abbreviation\\\": \\\"US\\\",\\n  \\\"places\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"place name\\\": \\\"Beverly Hills\\\",\\n      \\\"state\\\": \\\"California\\\",\\n      \\\"state abbreviation\\\": \\\"CA\\\",\\n      \\\"latitude\\\": \\\"34.0901\\\",\\n      \\\"longitude\\\": \\\"-118.4065\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWorking off of this, we check the validity of the response, and then extract / convert coordinates and return them if they are valid.\\n\\n\\n### Overpass API\\nFor the Overpass API, there is a Go client available, [go-overpass], however I am opting to use the 'net/http' package directly for simplicity. The Overpass API allows us to query OpenStreetMap data, which we can use to find businesses near the coordinates we obtained from the Zippopotamus API.\\n\\nThe current implementation uses a simple HTTP GET request to the Overpass API with a query that searches for nodes tagged as \\\"amenity\\\". For the purpose of this project we are looking for all business types within a certain radius, so my query looks like this:\\n```go\\n\\tquery := fmt.Sprintf(\\\"[out:json];node(around:%d,%f,%f)[amenity];out;\\\", radius, lat, lon)\\n```\\n\\nThis query will return all nodes (which are businesses in this case) within the specified radius of the given latitude and longitude. The results are then sent into a 'geo-results' JSON file, which is then used by the scraper to find job pages. Currently, this functionality is very very rough, and it simlpy returning JSON that looks like this:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"node\\\",\\n  \\\"id\\\": 12879790217,\\n  \\\"lat\\\": 39.2332032,\\n  \\\"lon\\\": -84.2498673\\n  \\\"tags\\\": {\\n\\t\\\"power\\\": \\\"terminal\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom this JSON, we have the lat and lgn of the business, and the ID of the node. Though not particularly helpful on it's own, this is enough to pass into the scaper, which will then use the ID to find the business website and then search for a job / career page.\\n\\n## Web (Scraping)\\nThe scraping functionality is implemented using Go's 'net/http' package to make HTTP requests and 'goquery' for parsing HTML. The scraper first locates all pages attached to a zipcode via our Geo Package, then parses every page within the radius. We are then parsing the HTML to find links that match common job listing patterns, such as \\\"careers\\\", \\\"jobs\\\", or \\\"employment\\\".\\n### Identifiers\\nHow do we identify business information, even something as simple as whether they have a website or not? \\n\\n\\n### Concurrency\\nThe scraper uses Go's goroutines to handle multiple HTTP requests concurrently, significantly speeding up the scraping process. Each request is handled in a separate goroutine, allowing the application to scrape multiple websites simultaneously without blocking the main thread.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},{type:\"project\",slug:\"portfolio\",title:\"zylarmccullah.tech\",subtitle:\"My ever-evolving web portfolio.\",technologies:[\"TypeScript\",\"React\"],links:{github:\"https://www.github.com/Mccullahz/portfolio\",demo:\"https://zylarmccullah.tech\"},content:\"\\n\\n# Table of contents\\n1.

[Animation](#animation)\\n\\n## Overview\\nThis is my personal portfolio website, built with TypeScript and React. It serves as a showcase for my projects, skills, and experiences. The site is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing visitors with an easy way to learn more about me and my work. \\n\\n## Structure\\nThis project is structured similar to a standard React application, with a strong emphasis on modularity and reusability. The main components are organized into directories based on their functionality, making it easy to navigate and maintain the codebase.\\n\\nThe component strucure in this project includes:\\n- **Contact**: A component for displaying my contact information and a form for visitors to reach out.\\n- **Education**: A component that lists my educational background, including degrees and certifications.\\n- **Experience**: A component that showcases my professional experience, including job titles, companies, and responsibilities.\\n- **Footer**: A component that contains the footer of the website, including links to my social media profiles and other relevant resources.\\n- **GuiCard**: A component that provides a guide for the non-cli based portfolio page\\n- **Header**: A component that contains the header of the website, including the navigation menu and logo.\\n- **Hero**: A component that serves as the hero section of the website, providing a brief introduction and call to action.\\n- **Navbar**: A component that contains the navigation bar, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the website.\\n- **ProjectPage**: A component that displays a command-line-esque list of my projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to the project repositories or live demos.\\n- **Skills**: A component that lists my skills and technologies I am proficient in, providing a quick overview of my technical capabilities.\\n\\n## Home\\nThe home page of my portfolio site is designed to read similar to a resume, providing an uber quick overview of experience skills and education. It is structured to give visitors a quick snapshot of my professional background and capabilities, with links to more detailed sections for those interested in learning more.\\n\\nThis page is quite simple, and simply serves the main components in a single page format:\\n```tsx\\n  <>\\n    <Hero />\\n    <Experience />\\n    <Skills />\\n    <Education />\\n    <Contact />\\n  </>\\n```\\n\\nRealistically, this page works just fine as is, however I do intend to add a couple of features in the future.\\nThe current idea that I have in mind is to add a layer of interactivity to the experience section, such that this will be less of a simple list, and rather appear as more of a timeline. This should allow for hovering over each position to reveal more information and then make some changes to a timeline undeneath the cards to show the duration of each position.\\n\\n\\n## Portfolio\\nThe portfolio page is designed to showcase my projects. There are two versions of this page, one for the CLI based portfolio and one for the web based portfolio. The CLI based portfolio is designed to appear like a terminal, while the web based portfolio is designed to look like a modern web app.\\n### CLI Portfolio\\n\\n### GUI Portfolio\\nThe GUI portfolio is designed to provide a more traditional web experience, with a focus on visual appeal and user interaction. It features a grid layout that displays my projects in a visually appealing manner, with each project represented by a card that includes a title, description, technologies used, and links to the project repository and a gif demo.\\n\\nI am currently working on a more advanced way to display my projects, with a focus on making it more interactive and engaging. The goal is to provide a more immersive experience for visitors, allowing them to explore my projects in greater detail and see the technologies I used in action. Currently we are using a simple card layout where each card represents a project and flips to reveal more information when hovered and redirects to the project page when clicked.\\n\\nTo change this, I am considering using a more dynamic setup, where this is more of a 3D rendering of my projects, with each project represented by a 3D card that can be rotated and interacted with. To do this, I am looking into using Three.js, and preloading a scene. I am thinking maybe doing something like a 3D coffee table, where each project is represented by a coffee mug, and the user can rotate the table to view different projects. This would allow for a more interactive experience, and would also allow me to showcase my abilities in 3D rendering and animation.\\n\\nSo with this in mind, let's get to work and see what we can knock out.\\n\\n#### Animation\\nThe animation for this page is likely going to be the most complex part of this project, so I am going to use Three.js to simplify this process. WIth react-three-fiber, we can easily integrate Three.js into our React application, allowing us to create 3D scenes and animations with *relative* ease.\\n\\nTo start, we will need to install the necessary dependencies:\\n```bash\\nnpm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei\\n```\\n\\nNext, we can create the component that will handle the 3D scene. This component will be responsible for rendering the 3D models of the projects, as well as handling any animations, lighting(maybe) or user interactions.\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport { Canvas } from \\\"@react-three/fiber\\\";\\nimport { OrbitControls, Environment } from \\\"@react-three/drei\\\";\\n\\nconst Mug: React.FC<{ position: [number, number, number] }> = ({ position }) => (\\n  <mesh position={position}>\\n    <cylinderGeometry args={[0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 32]} />\\n    <meshStandardMaterial color=\\\"#c49e6e\\\" />\\n  </mesh>\\n);\\n\\nconst Table: React.FC = () => (\\n  <mesh rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>\\n    <cylinderGeometry args={[2, 2, 0.1, 64]} />\\n    <meshStandardMaterial color=\\\"#4b3b2a\\\" />\\n  </mesh>\\n);\\n\\nconst Lights = () => (\\n  <>\\n    <ambientLight intensity={0.3} />\\n    <directionalLight position={[5, 5, 5]} intensity={1} castShadow />\\n  </>\\n);\\n\\nexport const ThreeScene: React.FC = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <Canvas\\n      shadows\\n      camera={{ position: [0, 2, 5], fov: 50 }}\\n      style={{ width: \\\"100%\\\", height: \\\"100vh\\\" }}\\n    >\\n      <Lights />\\n      <Environment preset=\\\"city\\\" />\\n      <OrbitControls enablePan={false} />\\n      <Table />\\n      <Mug position={[1, 0.3, 0]} />\\n      <Mug position={[-1, 0.3, 0]} />\\n      <Mug position={[0, 0.3, 1]} />\\n    </Canvas>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis example creates a simple 3D scene with a table and three cylinders representing projects. These are not yet mug shaped, but that will be a later me problem to make look nice. The 'OrbitControls' component allows for scene rotation. The 'Environment' component adds a background to the scene, enhancing the visual appeal.\\n\\nNow that we have this basic setup, we can start integrating this into the portfolio page. We can replace our current card setup with this created scene:\\n\\n```tsx \\n// inside Gui.tsx (where our portfolio is rendered)\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport { ThreeScene } from \\\"../components/Three\\\";\\n\\nexport const Gui: React.FC = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <div style={{ height: \\\"100vh\\\", width: \\\"100vw\\\" }}>\\n      <ThreeScene />\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis will render the 3D scene into the gui page, maintaining the full viewport height and width. This fits quite nicely, and the header component will still be rendered above the scene, allowing for navigation and interaction.\\n\\nNow lets address an initial issue. The 'table' is currently rotated the wrong way, so we need to adjust the rotation of the table mesh in the 'ThreeScene' component:\\n```tsx\\n<Table rotation={[Math.PI / 1, 0, 0]} />\\n```\\n\\nThis will ensure that the table is flat, I mistook the rotation direction in the initial example, but this works just fine now.\\n\\nNow that we have the basic setup and rendering properly, we can start adding more detail here. Next up is to address how we can differentiate between projects, and how we can make the mugs look more like actual coffee mugs.\\n\\nTo differentiate between projects, my idea is to add tickets to the mugs, which will contain the project title and a brief description similar to the conent from the cards before. This will allow us to easily identify each project, and will also allow us to add more information about each project in the future.\\n\\nTo do this, we can create a new object that contains project information. For this purpose, I am going to go with a 'ticket' onject becasue it is fitting and should allow us to do what we need here.\\n\\nThe current issue with the ticket object, adn will likely also be an issue with the mugs, is that their rotation is set once, and though this may be correct for 2 positions, is is going to be incorrect for the perpendicular sides of the tables. To address this, we can use the 'useFrame' hook from 'react-three-fiber' to update the rotation of the mugs and tickets based on their position on the table. I have never used this hook before, so let's see how we can implement it.\\n\\n\\n    \"},{type:\"project\",slug:\"flacer\",title:\"Flacer\",subtitle:\"An in development cross-platform high resolution audio player.\",technologies:[\"Go\",\"Wails\",\"TypeScript\"],links:{github:\"https://www.github.com/Mccullahz/flacer\"},content:\"\\nFlacer is a cross platform audio player designed for high resolution audio playback.

The rest of the Go packages are placed inside the internal directory, and further split into packages to modulate each function. \n\nTUI interface is inside the ui package, the 'scraper' that handles HTTP requests is located inside web, and so fourth.\n\n## Terminal Interface\nThe TUI is built using the Bubbletea library, which provides a simple and effective way to create terminal user interfaces in Go, and styled with the Lipgloss addition to Bubbletea. The interface allows users to input a ZIP code, select a radius for scraping, and view the results in a structured format. The UI is designed to be intuitive and responsive, and will eventually be able to provide real time feedback as the scraper processes each website.\n\n## Geo (Locator)\nThe 'Geo' package is responsible for the handling of geographic data, such as ZIP codes and their associated locations. The current idea is to use the [Zippopotamus API](https://docs.zippopotam.us/) to fetch location data based on ZIP codes. \nThis package should provide functionality to fetch geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). \n\nFrom here, we can use these coordinates to locate nearby businesses via the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). If this fails, we can pivot to either the Google Maps API or perhaps Yelp, but these will require 1.) API keys and 2.) money.\n\nOnce we have the coordinates from Zippopotamus, we can use the Overpass API to query OpenStreetMap for nearby businesses. We should then be able to throw the results into a 'geo-results' json file and throw the results into the 'web' package to be scraped.\n### Zippopotamus API\nWhile there is not an official Go client for the Zippopotamus API, it is a simple REST API that we can interact with using 'net/http'. This implementation can look the following example in the codebase:\n\\`\\`\\`go\nfunc GetCoordinatesFromZip(zip string) (float64, float64, error) {\n\turl := fmt.Sprintf(\"https://api.zippopotam.us/us/%s\", zip)\n\tresp, err := http.Get(url)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"HTTP request failed: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer resp.Body.Close()\n\n\tbody, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"reading response failed: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tvar data ZippoResponse\n\tif err := json.Unmarshal(body, &data); err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"JSON unmarshal failed: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tif len(data.Places) == 0 {\n\t\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"no places found for zip %s\", zip)\n\t}\n\n\tplace := data.Places[0]\n\tlat, err1 := strconv.ParseFloat(place.Latitude, 64)\n\tlon, err2 := strconv.ParseFloat(place.Longitude, 64)\n\tif err1 != nil || err2 != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, 0, fmt.Errorf(\"invalid coordinates in API response\")\n\t}\n\n\treturn lat, lon, nil\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nWhile this function is perhaps one of the most significant in this project, it is also quite simple. All we are doing is making a GET request to the Zippo API, reading the response, and unmarshalling the JSON into a struct. \n\nWe know that our JSON will look similar to this:\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n{\n  \"post code\": \"90210\",\n  \"country\": \"United States\",\n  \"country abbreviation\": \"US\",\n  \"places\": [\n    {\n      \"place name\": \"Beverly Hills\",\n      \"state\": \"California\",\n      \"state abbreviation\": \"CA\",\n      \"latitude\": \"34.0901\",\n      \"longitude\": \"-118.4065\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nWorking off of this, we check the validity of the response, and then extract / convert coordinates and return them if they are valid.\n\n\n### Overpass API\nFor the Overpass API, there is a Go client available, [go-overpass], however I am opting to use the 'net/http' package directly for simplicity. The Overpass API allows us to query OpenStreetMap data, which we can use to find businesses near the coordinates we obtained from the Zippopotamus API.\n\nThe current implementation uses a simple HTTP GET request to the Overpass API with a query that searches for nodes tagged as \"amenity\". For the purpose of this project we are looking for all business types within a certain radius, so my query looks like this:\n\\`\\`\\`go\n\tquery := fmt.Sprintf(\"[out:json];node(around:%d,%f,%f)[amenity];out;\", radius, lat, lon)\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis query will return all nodes (which are businesses in this case) within the specified radius of the given latitude and longitude. The results are then sent into a 'geo-results' JSON file, which is then used by the scraper to find job pages. Currently, this functionality is very very rough, and it simlpy returning JSON that looks like this:\n\\`\\`\\`json\n{\n  \"type\": \"node\",\n  \"id\": 12879790217,\n  \"lat\": 39.2332032,\n  \"lon\": -84.2498673\n  \"tags\": {\n\t\"power\": \"terminal\"\n  }\n}\n\n  ]\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nFrom this JSON, we have the lat and lgn of the business, and the ID of the node. Though not particularly helpful on it's own, this is enough to pass into the scaper, which will then use the ID to find the business website and then search for a job / career page.\n\n## Web (Scraping)\nThe scraping functionality is implemented using Go's 'net/http' package to make HTTP requests and 'goquery' for parsing HTML. The scraper first locates all pages attached to a zipcode via our Geo Package, then parses every page within the radius. We are then parsing the HTML to find links that match common job listing patterns, such as \"careers\", \"jobs\", or \"employment\".\n### Identifiers\nHow do we identify business information, even something as simple as whether they have a website or not? \n\n\n### Concurrency\nThe scraper uses Go's goroutines to handle multiple HTTP requests concurrently, significantly speeding up the scraping process. Each request is handled in a separate goroutine, allowing the application to scrape multiple websites simultaneously without blocking the main thread.\n\n\n\n`,\n  },\n\n  {\n    type: \"project\",\n    slug: \"portfolio\",\n    title: \"zylarmccullah.tech\",\n    subtitle: \"My ever-evolving web portfolio.\",\n    technologies: [\"TypeScript\", \"React\"],\n    links: {\n      github: \"https://www.github.com/Mccullahz/portfolio\",\n      demo: \"https://zylarmccullah.tech\",\n    },\n    content: `\n\n# Table of contents\n1.

[Animation](#animation)\n\n## Overview\nThis is my personal portfolio website, built with TypeScript and React. It serves as a showcase for my projects, skills, and experiences. The site is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing visitors with an easy way to learn more about me and my work. \n\n## Structure\nThis project is structured similar to a standard React application, with a strong emphasis on modularity and reusability. The main components are organized into directories based on their functionality, making it easy to navigate and maintain the codebase.\n\nThe component strucure in this project includes:\n- **Contact**: A component for displaying my contact information and a form for visitors to reach out.\n- **Education**: A component that lists my educational background, including degrees and certifications.\n- **Experience**: A component that showcases my professional experience, including job titles, companies, and responsibilities.\n- **Footer**: A component that contains the footer of the website, including links to my social media profiles and other relevant resources.\n- **GuiCard**: A component that provides a guide for the non-cli based portfolio page\n- **Header**: A component that contains the header of the website, including the navigation menu and logo.\n- **Hero**: A component that serves as the hero section of the website, providing a brief introduction and call to action.\n- **Navbar**: A component that contains the navigation bar, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the website.\n- **ProjectPage**: A component that displays a command-line-esque list of my projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to the project repositories or live demos.\n- **Skills**: A component that lists my skills and technologies I am proficient in, providing a quick overview of my technical capabilities.\n\n## Home\nThe home page of my portfolio site is designed to read similar to a resume, providing an uber quick overview of experience skills and education. It is structured to give visitors a quick snapshot of my professional background and capabilities, with links to more detailed sections for those interested in learning more.\n\nThis page is quite simple, and simply serves the main components in a single page format:\n\\`\\`\\`tsx\n  <>\n    <Hero />\n    <Experience />\n    <Skills />\n    <Education />\n    <Contact />\n  </>\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nRealistically, this page works just fine as is, however I do intend to add a couple of features in the future.\nThe current idea that I have in mind is to add a layer of interactivity to the experience section, such that this will be less of a simple list, and rather appear as more of a timeline. This should allow for hovering over each position to reveal more information and then make some changes to a timeline undeneath the cards to show the duration of each position.\n\n\n## Portfolio\nThe portfolio page is designed to showcase my projects. There are two versions of this page, one for the CLI based portfolio and one for the web based portfolio. The CLI based portfolio is designed to appear like a terminal, while the web based portfolio is designed to look like a modern web app.\n### CLI Portfolio\n\n### GUI Portfolio\nThe GUI portfolio is designed to provide a more traditional web experience, with a focus on visual appeal and user interaction. It features a grid layout that displays my projects in a visually appealing manner, with each project represented by a card that includes a title, description, technologies used, and links to the project repository and a gif demo.\n\nI am currently working on a more advanced way to display my projects, with a focus on making it more interactive and engaging. The goal is to provide a more immersive experience for visitors, allowing them to explore my projects in greater detail and see the technologies I used in action. Currently we are using a simple card layout where each card represents a project and flips to reveal more information when hovered and redirects to the project page when clicked.\n\nTo change this, I am considering using a more dynamic setup, where this is more of a 3D rendering of my projects, with each project represented by a 3D card that can be rotated and interacted with. To do this, I am looking into using Three.js, and preloading a scene. I am thinking maybe doing something like a 3D coffee table, where each project is represented by a coffee mug, and the user can rotate the table to view different projects. This would allow for a more interactive experience, and would also allow me to showcase my abilities in 3D rendering and animation.\n\nSo with this in mind, let's get to work and see what we can knock out.\n\n#### Animation\nThe animation for this page is likely going to be the most complex part of this project, so I am going to use Three.js to simplify this process. WIth react-three-fiber, we can easily integrate Three.js into our React application, allowing us to create 3D scenes and animations with *relative* ease.\n\nTo start, we will need to install the necessary dependencies:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nnpm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nNext, we can create the component that will handle the 3D scene. This component will be responsible for rendering the 3D models of the projects, as well as handling any animations, lighting(maybe) or user interactions.\n\n\\`\\`\\`tsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { Canvas } from \"@react-three/fiber\";\nimport { OrbitControls, Environment } from \"@react-three/drei\";\n\nconst Mug: React.FC<{ position: [number, number, number] }> = ({ position }) => (\n  <mesh position={position}>\n    <cylinderGeometry args={[0.3, 0.3, 0.5, 32]} />\n    <meshStandardMaterial color=\"#c49e6e\" />\n  </mesh>\n);\n\nconst Table: React.FC = () => (\n  <mesh rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>\n    <cylinderGeometry args={[2, 2, 0.1, 64]} />\n    <meshStandardMaterial color=\"#4b3b2a\" />\n  </mesh>\n);\n\nconst Lights = () => (\n  <>\n    <ambientLight intensity={0.3} />\n    <directionalLight position={[5, 5, 5]} intensity={1} castShadow />\n  </>\n);\n\nexport const ThreeScene: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <Canvas\n      shadows\n      camera={{ position: [0, 2, 5], fov: 50 }}\n      style={{ width: \"100%\", height: \"100vh\" }}\n    >\n      <Lights />\n      <Environment preset=\"city\" />\n      <OrbitControls enablePan={false} />\n      <Table />\n      <Mug position={[1, 0.3, 0]} />\n      <Mug position={[-1, 0.3, 0]} />\n      <Mug position={[0, 0.3, 1]} />\n    </Canvas>\n  );\n};\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis example creates a simple 3D scene with a table and three cylinders representing projects. These are not yet mug shaped, but that will be a later me problem to make look nice. The 'OrbitControls' component allows for scene rotation. The 'Environment' component adds a background to the scene, enhancing the visual appeal.\n\nNow that we have this basic setup, we can start integrating this into the portfolio page. We can replace our current card setup with this created scene:\n\n\\`\\`\\`tsx \n// inside Gui.tsx (where our portfolio is rendered)\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { ThreeScene } from \"../components/Three\";\n\nexport const Gui: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ height: \"100vh\", width: \"100vw\" }}>\n      <ThreeScene />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis will render the 3D scene into the gui page, maintaining the full viewport height and width. This fits quite nicely, and the header component will still be rendered above the scene, allowing for navigation and interaction.\n\nNow lets address an initial issue. The 'table' is currently rotated the wrong way, so we need to adjust the rotation of the table mesh in the 'ThreeScene' component:\n\\`\\`\\`tsx\n<Table rotation={[Math.PI / 1, 0, 0]} />\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis will ensure that the table is flat, I mistook the rotation direction in the initial example, but this works just fine now.\n\nNow that we have the basic setup and rendering properly, we can start adding more detail here. Next up is to address how we can differentiate between projects, and how we can make the mugs look more like actual coffee mugs.\n\nTo differentiate between projects, my idea is to add tickets to the mugs, which will contain the project title and a brief description similar to the conent from the cards before. This will allow us to easily identify each project, and will also allow us to add more information about each project in the future.\n\nTo do this, we can create a new object that contains project information. For this purpose, I am going to go with a 'ticket' onject becasue it is fitting and should allow us to do what we need here.\n\nThe current issue with the ticket object, adn will likely also be an issue with the mugs, is that their rotation is set once, and though this may be correct for 2 positions, is is going to be incorrect for the perpendicular sides of the tables. To address this, we can use the 'useFrame' hook from 'react-three-fiber' to update the rotation of the mugs and tickets based on their position on the table. I have never used this hook before, so let's see how we can implement it.\n\n\n    `\n  },\n\n  {\n    type: \"project\",\n    slug: \"flacer\",\n    title: \"Flacer\",\n    subtitle: \"An in development cross-platform high resolution audio player.\",\n    technologies: [\"Go\", \"Wails\", \"TypeScript\"],\n    links: {\n      github: \"https://www.github.com/Mccullahz/flacer\",\n    },\n    content: `\nFlacer is a cross platform audio player designed for high resolution audio playback.
