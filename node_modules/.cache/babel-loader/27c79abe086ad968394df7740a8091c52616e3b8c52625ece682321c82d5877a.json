The goal is to automate localized job hunting by surfacing hiring pages often buried in small business websites. \n\nBy searching only these local businesses, applicants can find job opportunities that may not be listed on larger job boards, reducing resume traffic and potentially aiding in landing a desired position.\n\n## Structure\nThis project is structured similar to a standard Go application, with the main logic in the 'cmd' directory. This main function only acts as the entry point of the project. The rest of the Go packages are placed inside the internal directory, and further split into packages to modulate each function. \n\nTUI interface is inside the ui package, the 'scraper' that handles HTTP requests is located inside web, and so fourth.\n\n## Terminal Interface\nThe TUI is built using the Bubbletea library, which provides a simple way to create terminal user interfaces in Go. The interface allows users to input a ZIP code, select a radius for scraping, and view the results in a structured format. The UI is designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing real-time feedback as the scraper processes each website.\n\n\n## Scraping\nThe scraping functionality is implemented using Go's 'net/http' package to make HTTP requests and 'goquery' for parsing HTML. The scraper first locates all pages attached to a zipcode via our Geo Package, then parses every page within the radius. We are then parsing the HTML to find links that match common job listing patterns, such as \"careers\", \"jobs\", or \"employment\".\n### Concurrency\nThe scraper uses Go's goroutines to handle multiple HTTP requests concurrently, significantly speeding up the scraping process. Each request is handled in a separate goroutine, allowing the application to scrape multiple websites simultaneously without blocking the main thread.\n\n`\n}, {\n  type: \"project\",\n  slug: \"flacer\",\n  title: \"Flacer\",\n  subtitle: \"An in development cross-platform high resolution audio player.\",\n  technologies: [\"Go\", \"Wails\", \"TypeScript\"],\n  links: {\n    github: \"https://www.github.com/Mccullahz/flacer\"\n  },\n  content: `\nFlacer is a cross platform audio player designed for high resolution audio playback.
